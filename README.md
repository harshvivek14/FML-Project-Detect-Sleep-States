◦  Built a robust sleep onset and wake detection model using time-series data from wrist-worn accelerometers
with RNNs and Random Forests to enhance sleep state prediction accuracy.

◦ Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline with EDA, model training, and optimization of memory usage, by
conducting feature engineering and data preprocessing on a 127-million-row dataset.
