**Goal of the Competition:**

The goal of this competition is to detect sleep onset and wake. You will develop a model trained on wrist-worn accelerometer data in order to determine a person's sleep state.

Your work could make it possible for researchers to conduct more reliable, larger-scale sleep studies across a range of populations and contexts. The results of such studies could provide even more information about sleep.

The successful outcome of this competition can also have significant implications for children and youth, especially those with mood and behavior difficulties. Sleep is crucial in regulating mood, emotions, and behavior in individuals of all ages, particularly children. By accurately detecting periods of sleep and wakefulness from wrist-worn accelerometer data, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of sleep patterns and better understand disturbances in children.
